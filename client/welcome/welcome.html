                        <strong>Introduction</strong> <br />
                        Hi, welcome to this survey. For those of you who don't know me, my name is
                        <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeroenp" target="_blank">Jeroen Peeters</a>. I'm currently working on my
                        master thesis. This survey is part of my master thesis research.
                      </p>
                      <p class="col-md-12">
                        <span class="fa fa-long-arrow-right"></span>
                        <strong>What is it about?</strong> <br />
                        The goal of this survey is to gather data on the topic of Java method naming.
                      </p>
                      <p class="col-md-12">
                        <span class="fa fa-long-arrow-right"></span>
                        <strong>What do I need from you?</strong> <br />
                        In order to get as much data points as possible I kindly request you to take part in this survey.
                        However, there is an intake test to make sure that you fit the intended group of respondents.
                      </p>
                      <p class="col-md-12">
                        <span class="fa fa-long-arrow-right"></span>
                        <strong>How long does it take?</strong> <br />
                        The survey will take about 15 to 20 minutes of your time. It is possible to stop and resume the survey at a later time.
                        If you want to stop I encourage you to do so and come back later. No worries if you don't complete the entire test,
                        the data is still usable.
                      </p>

                        <span class="fa fa-long-arrow-right"></span>
                        <strong>Ok, lets start!</strong> <br />
                        Very well, the intake test is on the next page. Use the buttons below to navigate during the entire survey.
